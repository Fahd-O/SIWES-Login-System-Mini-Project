# Simple Signup and Login System with PHP and MySQL

This project is a step by step follow-up of a YouTube tutorial <https://youtu.be/WYufSGgaCZ8?si=1l5c4uscZiz-rFje> on how to build a simple signup and login system using PHP and MySQL. It's the tutorial's replica. It includes features such as user registration, login, and session management. It was after this that I was able to build a customized login system for my SIWES project task.

## Features

- User registration with validation
- User login with session management
- Password hashing for security
- Simple and clean user interface

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
